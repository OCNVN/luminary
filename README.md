# Augmented Reality

By using Microsoft XNA, Goblin technology we project a 3D character capable of express basic words based on the vocabulary stored in the internal DB or any letter from the alphabet in case of unknown words.

New words can be added to the DB by storing new skeletal animations exported from third party 3D Animation tools like Maya or 3D Studio Max, the character's mesh will move accordingly.

## Realtime Interaction

Interactive elements can be added to the scene, such elements can interact between each other, speed and collision detection is being used in order to achieve that.

## Communication

By using built-in speech to text technology we can translate voice and text to sign language, the communication happens trough a basic protocol written with sockets over UDP.
